- What is an ORM? What do they do?
 is a piece of software designed to translate between the data representations used by databases and those used in object-oriented programming. Basically, these two ways of working with data don't naturally fit together, so an ORM attempts to bridge the gap between the two systems' data designs.

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?
Ajax is the traditional way to make an asynchronous HTTP request. Data can be sent using the HTTP POST method and received using the HTTP GET method.

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?
A CSRF Token is a secret, unique and unpredictable value a server-side application generates in order to protect CSRF vulnerable resources. The tokens are generated and submitted by the server-side application in a subsequent HTTP request made by the client.
